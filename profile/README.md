About Patchwork Archive

Patchwork Archive aims to archive original songs and covers created by VTubers.
With loss of content being a major issue in VTubing (due to termination and graduations), the goal
of Patchwork Archive is to preserve a subset of VTuber content for preservation of culture.

Original songs and covers are archived. Short form content is archived on a case by
case basis (usually it'll be archived if its a unique cover or song not available elsewhere)
All archived content was available publicly on YouTube at the time of processing.

The idea for Patchwork is greatly inspired by Ragtag Archive. Thank you for your hard work!!

Currently we archive the following data for each video:

    1080p version of each video [lower if unavailable]
    Highest available resolution thumbnail (maxresdefault.jpg) [lower if unavailable]
    Metadata (in the form of .info.json generated by yt-dlp)
    All non-livechat and auto-generated captions in srv3
