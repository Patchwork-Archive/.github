## About Patchwork Archive

Patchwork Archive aims to archive original songs and covers created by VTubers. The goal
of Patchwork Archive is to preserve a subset of VTuber content for preservation of culture.

Original songs and covers are archived. Short form content is archived on a case by
case basis (usually it'll be archived if its a unique cover or song not available elsewhere)

All archived content was available publicly on YouTube at the time of processing.

## What's archived
Currently we archive the following data for each video:

- 1080p version of each video [lower if unavailable]
- Highest available resolution thumbnail (maxresdefault.jpg) [lower if unavailable]
- Metadata (in the form of .info.json generated by yt-dlp)
- All non-livechat and auto-generated captions as YouTube Timed Text


# Support
Patchwork Archive will forever remain freely accessible and without ads. I will always do my best to ensure things continue running smoothly, however due to the nature of archival I cannot make any additional guarantees.

That said any donations will be put towards cost of CDN (serving content) and storage.
